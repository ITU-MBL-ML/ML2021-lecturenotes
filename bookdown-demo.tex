Thursday 13:30-1630

\hypertarget{content}{%
\section{Content}\label{content}}

The course is an introduction to \emph{Machine Learning} methods with examples from \emph{architectural design and creative coding}. The course follows a hands on approach with many examples that will be developed during the course. The course includes topics from machine learning such as linear regression, unsupervised learning, supervised learning, reinforcement learning and finally neural networks.

\hypertarget{aims}{%
\section{Aims}\label{aims}}

To have students acquire practical knowledge on the tools of machine learning and different methodologies. To have students knowledge of applying these techniques to creative design process.

\hypertarget{conduct}{%
\section{Conduct}\label{conduct}}

The first half of the term includes introduction to the various machine learning topics. In this phase there will be practical coding sessions and some assignments which will be graded. In the second half of the term we will focus on a group project which will be developed using neural networks.
The grading for the course is as follows: attendance and in-class participation in coding challenges 20\%; hands-on practices, 20\%; final project presentation by group (or solo if prefered) 60\%.

Most famous VCS are;

Git
Subversion
Mercurial

In this course, we will use Git.

\hypertarget{terminology}{%
\subsubsection{Terminology}\label{terminology}}

\emph{Version Control System / Source Code Manager}

Git is a SCM or VCS that stores the status of the files for us.

\emph{Commit}
When a commit is made Git stores the contents of all the files that are in the staging area. It is like saving in a game.

\emph{Repository / repo}
A repository is a directory that contains your project.

\emph{Working Directory}
Working Directory is the directory that is configured in the init for the repo.

\emph{Checkout}
A checkout is when content in the repository has been copied to the Working Directory.

\emph{Staging Area / Staging Index / Index}
A file in the Git directory that stores information about what will go into your next commit. You can think of the staging area as a prep table where Git will take the next commit. Files on the Staging Index are poised to be added to the repository.

\emph{SHA}
A SHA is basically an ID number for each commit. Here's what a commit's SHA might look like: e2adf8ae3e2e4ed40add75cc44cf9d0a869afeb6.

It is a 40-character string composed of characters (0--9 and a--f) and calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git. ``SHA'' is shorthand for ``Secure Hash Algorithm''. If you're interested in learning about hashes, check out our Intro to Computer Science course.

\emph{Branch}
A branch is when a new line of development is created that diverges from the main line of development. This alternative line of development can continue without altering the main line.

Modifying the Last Commit

\texttt{git\ commit\ -\/-amend}

Reverting a Commit

\texttt{git\ revert\ \textless{}SHA\ of\ a\ commit\textgreater{}}

Deleting a Commit
can be dangerous
\texttt{git\ reset}
